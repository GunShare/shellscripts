About patches
-------------
The basic idea is to make a separate patch for each modification, rather than
include several modifications in a sigle patch. Therefore, patches must 
satisfy either of the following conditions:

* addition/removal of a single file

* addition/removal of tightly related files

* modification of a single file

* modification of tightly related files
